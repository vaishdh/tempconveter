Hello 
We’ll learn how to make a Temperature Converter Website Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that converts a location’s temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. We will utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to finish this temperature converter project in today’s lesson.

The HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) will help us to create the structure for the list with some necessary attributes and elements to make Temperature Converter.

Then we will use CSS (Cascading Stylesheet) which will help us to style or design the project with suitable padding and alignment in the Temperature Converter project.

At last, we will use JS (JavaScript) which will add logic to make the Temperature Converter project responsive from the user end. I hope you have got an idea about the project.
